    <h2>Slow Smoked Ribs</h2>
    <h3>Set aside a few hours. It'll be worth it. I promise.</h3>
    <h4>Ever wanted to make some badass ribs, without having to do too much? Well now's your chance. Grab a case of beer, sit down, and get ready - because here we go.</h4>
    <p>You'll need the following ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 rack baby back ribs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Signature Sweet Rub (or any sort of rub you like. Feel free to make your own)</li>
        <li>1 cup apple cider (apple juice works too)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp salted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of your favorite BBQ sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Got it all? Great. If not, I'd recommend going to the store. Or don't. It's your food. Do what you want.</p>
    <p>Let's go over how to actually make them. It's really not that difficult.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by removing the membrane on the back of the ribs</li>
        <li>Liberally season both sides of the ribs using the sweet rub, starting with the bone side</li>
        <li>Prepare your smoker for indirect smoking. Target temperature is between 180-200 with thin blue smoke. Place the seasoned ribs on the smoker and close the lid. Leave them to smoke for 3 hours</li>
        <li>Tear off a large piece of aluminum foil and place it on a large working surface. Transfer the ribs to the foil bone side up so the bones don't tear through the foil. Sprinkle with the brown sugar, top with the butter cut into small pads, and then pour over the apple cider</li>
        <li>Tightly crimp the foil together to create an airtight seal. Return to the grill and increase your cooking temperature to as close to 225 degrees as you can get it. Let the ribs braise for 2 hours in the foil</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the ribs from the grill and place on a large working surface. Open the foil package (be careful of hot steam) and use tongs to remove the ribs and place them back on the grill, bone side down. Discard the foil and excess cooking liquid</li>
        <li>Brush the ribs with your favorite BBQ sauce, close the lid of your grill and cook at 225 degrees for an additional hour until the ribs are done to your desired tenderness and the sauce is sticky and set</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After that solid 6 hours of work, your ribs will be complete. Sit down with a nice Miller High Life, and enjoy~</p>
