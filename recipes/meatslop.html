        <h2>Doesn't look that great, does it?</h2>
        <p>No shit, Sherlock. Yeah, it doesn't look great - but this isn't the sort of food that you're eating for flavor. This is hardcore body building food. This is the sorta shit that you eat to hit some gains. To get somewhere with your life.</p>
        <p>With that being said, let's get right down to it. This is bulking food, keep that in mind.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground meat of some form; lean beef works well. Anything between a pound or a kilogram really</li>
            <li>Cabbage of some sort; I prefer red (more anthocyanin content, whoo!) although green tastes less ‘cabbagy’ and might be good to start off with for those who don’t like cabbage. 2 medium sized (18in circumference) are good.</li>
            <li>Tomato paste or an equivalent flavored paste; I personally use two cans (591mL) of the lowest calorie tomato paste I can get, usually the cheap stuff</li>
            <li>Red onions and mushrooms</li>
            <li>Something green for colouring</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, 2 eggs or so can be cracked into the pot upon reheating on the stovetop. This, aside from eating eggs, increases the viscosity of the slop and makes it more palatable.
            Almost every sauce works well with meat slop as well, and it seems to carry the flavors of sauce quite nicely.</p>
        <p><strong>Why make meat slop?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>This batch will last me for a week (7 servings)</li>
            <li>It cost $16.14 in total this time around, due to a sale on beef</li>
            <li>It makes your poops majestic due to the fiber content, second only to psyllium husk</li>
            <li>Its a bowl of meat. Meat, a bowl of it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Sloppening</h2>
        <p>Here's how you make it</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First is to gather your chosen ammunition for the fight; below I have my vegetables, tomato paste, meat, and a refreshment.</li>
            <li>Now you take your cabbage, and shred that fucker with the hatred of a thousand suns</li>
            <li>put all the cabbage into a big ass pot (emphasis on the size here).</li>
            <li>Then mix it with the tomato paste</li>
            <li>Aaaand then everything else you have on hand</li>
            <li>add spices to it or just head straight to cooking</li>
            <li>Let it bubble a bit and then let it simmer until all the meat turns brown (20-30 minutes); keep on adding water so the slop does not burn at the bottom of the pot, but don’t add so much that it turns into a soup.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Nutritional Information</h2>
        <p>Nutritional information will vary depending on what you put in; especially in regards to the meat. With the amounts I used above, and using WolframAlpha as my guide, I am to the following information (Calories/Fat/Carb/Protein/Fiber):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Both cabbage heads (832/5/192/32/64)</li>
            <li>Onion (44/0/10/1/2)</li>
            <li>Mushrooms (60/1/9/9/3)</li>
            <li>Tomato Paste (NoName brand) (509/0/108/24/24)</li>
            <li>Lean (10%) ground beef; 1.389kg of it (2950/146/0/373/0)</li>
            <li>Overall: (4395/151/219/439/93) Macronutrient Breakdown: Almost a perfect 40/40/20 Pro/Fat/Carb</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Divided by 7 into my serving size yields 630kcal, 22 fat, 63 protein, 31 carbohydrate, 13 fiber
            For those curious, I ran the numbers with all the above exactly the same but only using 454g (one pound) of lean ground turkey and came out with (2369/54/219/187/94) Overall and, if divided by seven, (340/8/31/27/13). A lower calorie albeit lower protein option.</p>
