        <p>For the love of God, please come check out this chili recipes.</p>
        <p><a href="./recipes/chili.html">Recently, I've been doing chili runs of some of my favorite video games. It's where I have to eat 5 spoonfuls of chili every time I press the "A" button.</p></a>
        <p>Did you like that? I bet you fucking did. You little chili <strong>slut</strong>. You should take a look at my <a href="./recipes/ribs.html">ribs recipe.</a> It <strong>FUCKS</strong></p>
        <p>By now, you've hopefully figured out that most of my cooking is meat oriented. Not sure why that is, just something about it really makes me happy.</p>
        <p>The final recipe that you'll find here however, is an old one from the ages of body build forums online. The ever ellusive, <a href="./recipes/meatslop.html">Meat Slop.</a></p>
